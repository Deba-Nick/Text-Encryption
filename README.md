# Text-Encryption
This program implements a Columnar Transposition Cipher, a classical encryption technique. The user enters a plaintext message and a numeric key, and the program:

Encrypts the message by arranging it in rows and reading it column by column.

Decrypts the resulting ciphertext by reversing the process, reconstructing the original plaintext.

The key determines the number of columns in the matrix used for rearranging characters during encryption and decryption.
